         "Description: The world today has bought on a need to pay increased attention to safety and security issues, for example, search and rescue operations, surveillance, and protection of critical infrastructure. These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class. Background: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately. Detailed Description: Classification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler’s, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis. A Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification. Expected Solution: Input: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird Output: Class of the object(Drone or Bird)",

         "Background: The load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand. Description: The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs. Further, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive. Expected Solution: An Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.",

         "Background: There are numerous engineering and polytechnic institutes in Rajasthan running under the Department of Technical Education, Government of Rajasthan. Notably, during the admission process, there is a significant increase in enquiries from various groups, including students, their parents, and other stakeholders. These enquiries cover a wide range of queries related to admission process, eligibility criteria, information about different colleges, fee structure, curriculum , scholarship , hostel facilities, previous year's college and branch-specific allotments placement opportunities and many more. Currently, stakeholders have tocontact colleges individually through phone or email, and sometimes even visit the colleges personally. This process is not only cumbersome for the stakeholders but also demanding to pool manpower for the colleges to manage these inquiries. Detailed Description: With the continuous rise in enquiries, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the colleges to respond promptly and effectively using traditional communication methods. To address this issue more efficiently and ensure timely assistance for everyone, there is a pressing need to adopt new technological solutions. One effective approach is to develop an AI-powered chatbot at centralized level that would serve as a virtual assistant, available 24/7 to answer a wide range of questions. By automating responses to common enquiries, the chatbot would significantly enhance the accessibility to important information and allow staff to focus on handling more complex queries and other critical tasks. For example, the chatbot would provide insights into information about various engineering and polytechnic colleges that falls under the jurisdiction of Department of Technical Education, and guide users through the admission processes, explain fee structures, share curriculum updates, provide details about available scholarships, share alumni information, and share information on job placement opportunities etc This will empower the technical education department because of the ease of providing information, help and advice instantly to prospective students, their parents, and all interested parties. The required information provided by all colleges can be integrated with ease in software. Expected Solutions: 1. Efficient Information Retrieval: The chatbot should rapidly access and provide accurate information from a comprehensive database on topics such as admissions, fees, scholarships, recommendations based on previous years cutoff, minimizing the need for human assistance. Incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to support voice based assistance in English languages and can be extended in Hindi and other regional languages ensuring wide accessibility and understanding. 2. Enhanced User Experience: Design an intuitive interface that allows users to navigate easily and find information quickly. The interface should be straightforward, accessible on common platform, and capable of understanding natural language, ensuring user-friendliness. 3. Reduced Workload: By automating responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s), the chatbot will reduce the workload on department staff, allowing them to concentrate on more complex and urgent tasks. 4. Data Insights: The chatbot will gather valuable data from user interactions, helping the department to identify common concerns and optimize it’s services based on these insights.",

         "Background: India faces a complex challenge in balancing its reliance on coal for energy with its climate change commitments. Coal mining is a major source of carbon emissions, a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. To achieve carbon neutrality, the Indian coal sector needs to offset its emissions. This can be done through a combination of strategies like reducing emissions from mining activities, adopting cleaner technologies, and offsetting remaining emissions by planting trees that absorb carbon dioxide. A web-based application can be a powerful tool in this journey by helping quantify a mine's carbon footprint and evaluate potential pathways to carbon neutrality. Description: The web based application will have following objectives: Activity wise quantification of Carbon emission in Coal Mines Estimation of existing Carbon Sinks Gap analysis between C emission and sinks and suggesting pathways to carbon neutrality Expected Solution: A comprehensive software solution that includes: Emission estimation: The app would allow users to input data on various mining activities (e.g., excavation, transportation, equipment usage) and estimate the associated carbon emissions based on establishd emission factors. Estimation of Per Capita emissions of a Mine. Carbon Neutrality Pathways: The app could offer features for simulating different emission reduction strategies like: Clean technologies: Assessing the impact of adopting electric vehicles, methane capture systems, and renewable energy sources for mine operations. Afforestation offsets: Calculating the amount of land required for tree plantation to offset remaining emissions based on state specific afforestation plan and Carbon emission reduction. Other Renewables: explore alternative use of energy to reduce direct electricity consumption. Any other pathways: Carbon Credits: Estimation of potential Carbon credit earned as per present market rates. Data visualization: The app should present results visually, using charts and graphs to track emission trends and the effectiveness of implemented strategies. Scalability: Design the app to accommodate different mine sizes and types (underground vs open-cast). Benefits: Transparency: Providing a clear picture of a mine's carbon footprint. Decision support: Helping mine operators make informed choices for emission reduction. Cost savings: Identifying opportunities to optimize operations and potentially reduce costs associated with emissions. Sustainability goals: Aiding Indian coal mines in their journey towards carbon neutrality and supporting the country's overall climate goals.",

         "Description: Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems are the solar power generating products or systems that are seamlessly integrated into the building envelop. The satellite data from Indian Satellites such as Cartosat-2/3 and Cartosat-1 are capable of generating 3D city models up to LoD-1. These LoD1 models, which are derived by extruding a footprint to a uniform height, can be used for simulating building shadows. This project aims to develop an interactive application for assessing BIPV potential using LOD-1 3D city model. It will involve simulating shadow of adjoining buildings on each face of the building and estimating incident solar energy on the vertical face of the building. The application will render the building surface according to available BIPV potential. Challenge: * 3D Visualisation of LOD-1 City Model * Simulating Building Shadows in 3D * 3D Rendering of BIPV Potential on Building Usage: Application of Space-based inputs for Renewable Energy Users: The application will be deployed on VEDAS portal's '3D City Model and Rooftop Solar Potential' application. It will be usefu for Policy-makers (State & Central Government), Solar Energy Solution Providers, Architects and citizens. Available Solutions (if Yes, reasons for not using them): Commercial Architectural Packages like Autodesk are suitable for building-level analysis and require substantial level of details. 3D GIS packages such as ESRI City Engine or Cesium provide visualisation capabilities. Software for city-wide BIPV potential estimation are currently not available in public domain. Desired Outcome: An interactive application where user provides a date (for calculating sun-position) and daily Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) value, and the application generates corresponding 3D city model rendered according to incident solar energy for that day. The application also provide total BIPV and rooftop PV energy potential available in the building.",

Climate change is increasing the number and size of glacial lakes, heightening the risk of GLOFs. Curent monitoring and prediction methods can be improved with advanced technologies like remote sensing, sensors installed near glacial lakes and machine learning. • Description: The aim is to develop a remote sensing and/or sensor-based Early Warning System (EWS) for GLOFs by utilizing remote sensing data, network of IoT sensors and advanced data analytics. The system will continuously monitor and identify critical changes in lake size, water level, temperature, sudden water flow, dam stability and ground movement etc. around glacial lakes. The machine learning algorithms will analyse the information to detect early signs of potential outbursts. This approach will significantly enhance the capability to predict and respond to GLOFs, improving safety, reducing economic losses, and contributing to resilient infrastructure planning in glacial regions. • Expected Solution: A Sensor which can be installed in glacial lake area, or a predictive model that significantly improves the Early Warning System ability for GLOFs, providing critical lead time for evacuation and mitigation efforts.",

SAR image colorization using Deep Learning (DL) models offers a transformative approach for enhancing the interpretability of monochromatic SAR image data. The project aims to develop an innovative solution to colorize grayscale SAR images for enhanced interpretation and analysis of feature targets. A novel DL model needs to be designed and trained using pairs of SAR and Optical images, minimizing a loss function that captures the difference between predicted and actual color images. The participants are challenged to create a DL system that can accurately predict and apply colors to SAR images, making surface features more distinguishable and interpretable. Challenge: The challenges require innovative approaches in data pre-processing, DL model design, and evaluation methodologies to develop effective and reliable SAR image colorization solutions. Usage: The goal is to improve the usability of SAR data in applications like geological studies and environmental monitoring by providing more intuitive and informative visual representations. Users: Remote Sensing Image Analysts Available Solutions (if Yes, reasons for not using them): Existing Deep Learning models have been proposed and used but their performance is not satisfactory.

         "Background: The load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand. Description: The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs. Further, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive. Expected Solution: An Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.",

         "Background: Despite the thrust on energy transition from fossil fuel sector to a cost-competitive renewable energy sector, Coal will remain pivotal to energy security of the nation in near future. India is targeting for 1.5 Bt coal production by 2030 to cater to the burgeoning energy needs of the country. To achieve the target, improved productivity and safety in coal mining is pivotal. Description: The problem statement is divided into two parts: one is Digital shift handover log system and other is safety management plan as per DGMS guidelines. A digital shift handover log system is a valuable tool for streamlining and improving the transition of responsibilities and information from one shift to the next within an organization. The problem statement envisages that an app based and web based Shift handover log system be developed as per the Statutory and non-statutory log format currently in practice, which is presently being done manually through paper logs. This will ensure sharing of critical information and briefing of the next shift digitally. It will provide supervisors and operators with an immediate, comprehensive overview of the outgoing shift’s activities. Manual Shift handover causes loss of time and thus productivity of the mining operation. Also, some important information regarding safety may get skipped in the manual system which can cause serious damage to mining operation or loss of life. Digitalised system will ensure that all red flags are properly briefed and major actions which needs to be taken in the next shift is communicated to the shift in charge of next shift beforehand so that he can mentally prepare for the same. This will save time in the forthcoming shift and ensure better productivity. It will also ensure better safety and monitoring of the mine. Every mine has to prepare a Safety Management Plan (SMP) as per DGMS guidelines. This SMP is based on Hazard identification and devising control and monitoring mechanism and fixing responsibility. This SMP implementation needs to be digitalised in the software for better management of risks. Also, this app or web based solution needs to be integrated with ERP software. While designing the software, due care should be given to data security. Possible Solution: An app and web based application can be developed for every type of log book currently in use by supervisors and operators in mining operation and digitalising the Safety Management Plan currently being implemented by mine owners as per DGMS guidelines. Also the application should be able to streamline communication by automatically converting shift logs into organized PDF reports.",

         "Background: The impact of oil spills at sea is multifaceted, affecting the environment, economy, public health, and society at large. Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. Detailed description: The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel's unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently. As far as study area, any of the below options may be considered.

The tool/system should detect the anomalies in AIS around the vessel. The distress/anomaly zone has to be monitored for oil spills using Satellite datasets. This can help in early detection of oil leak from a ship or vessel. The information can be passed on to the regulatory authorities for quicker and efficient response.",

         "Background: INCOIS provides fishery advisory services to fishermen through potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories that proven to benefit fishing communities by making fishing more economical and reducing fuel consumption, as fishermen can directly target areas with abundant fish. Current research is focused on advancing the fisheries forecasting services through developing species-specific advisory services. However, predicting species-specific abundance requires a deep understanding of the habitat suitability of commercially important species. This requires analyzing fish catch data alongside environmental variables at the locations of fish occurrence and abundance, identifying the most important variables contributing to their abundance, and ultimately fitting these data to appropriate prediction models. INCOIS is striving to collect geo-referenced fish catch data from various sources, including data from other research Institutions, industry collaborators, research cruises, and a dedicated app that captures fisheries information through images from fish catch locations. However, at present there is no systematic mechanism to aggregate and store these information from multiple channels to a single data base. As a result, the data is highly scattered and disaggregated, leading to wastage of time and confusion among scientific personnel developing species-specific habitat suitability models, since this disorganization makes it difficult to access all available datasets for analysis. Detailed Description: Considering the difficulties in collecting georeferenced fish catch data, each single dataset is highly crucial for habitat suitability models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive database to store all available georeferenced fish catch information with appropriate filters and visualization tools. This would enable dedicated personnel to easily access and download all data available for a particular species. Such a dataset would also be highly beneficial for new scientists interested in working on different species, resulting in species specific advisory services for more species in future. Data input, classification and arrangement The software solution for the portal should handle input data in Excel format and organize it by date, location, depth, and species. Some datasets provide the weight of individual species, while others are only the aggregate weight of the catch with only the information on presence of individual species, not their catch weights. Therefore, there should be separate modules for occurrence and abundance of species. The module for abundance should store data that includes catch weight of individual species, while the module for occurrence should store data with and without catch weight. Users, Data output and visualization The users of the portal will primarily be scientific personnel working on specific species or multiple species, interested in visualizing and downloading data for their target species. Therefore, the portal should display search results for a species using appropriate maps and graphical formats, and also allow users to download the data in Excel/CSV format with columns for Date, Species, Latitude, Longitude, Catch Weight, and Depth. -In some instances, scientific personnel may also be interested in studying the fish assemblage patterns of multiple species within a particular geographical area over time. Thus, the output filters should also allow users to filter data by area (using latitude and longitude bounds) and display the occurrences and abundances of all available species over different time scales, along with relevant data on their depth of occurrence. Data Accessibility The Data repository should have an admin page to continuously update the database, and users should be able to login with appropriate credentials to access the data. Expected Solution: A comprehensive data base to feed, arrange, store and visualize disaggregated data on fish catch. This would make research towards species-specific fisheries forecasts hassle-free and smooth, saving time and effort in collecting and compiling information, allowing researchers to focus on more productive tasks.",

To realize that, in 2017, it was decided that the decade of 2021-30 is to be observed as UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (or UN Ocean Decade). INCOIS is identified as UN Ocean Decade Collaborative Centre for the Indian Ocean Region to help address all the ten UN Ocean Decade challenges (https://oceandecade.org/challenges/). Description: The creative solution proposed herein will address mainly (but not limited to) challenge-10. The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html. Expected Solution: The user will be able to chose from a variety of sea-going roles e.g. but not limited to, fishermen, captain of a ship, tourism operator etc. Based on the role, one needs to choose the correct sea conditions to be at a location (or move away) with the help of available/applicable ocean information services form INCOIS (simulated for the game). Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly.

UIDAI is considering the injection of ML model by using an appropriate binary code delivery mechanism. The security of these models is important for transaction integrity and therefore seeking an innovative solution that will protect the model from any tampering and reverse engineering. 2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to demonstrate model security in a browser context by using either obfuscation or cryptography. Models are typically 5~7Mb in size and structured as flatbuffers. These models would be downloaded, when for the first time accessed on a desktop and then cached in the browser context. For subsequent face authentication transactions, a cached model would be preferred, unless otherwise the model has changed or updated. To solve the above problem statement, teams are free to choose either ONNX web runtime or Tensor.js or any other innovative model to distribute the model in the browser context.

The solution must not significantly increase the size of the model post-implementation of security frameworks. Models are expected to be downloaded in 3G/4G/5G wireless networks and hence any increase in size may lead to deteriorated user experience. 3 The solution must feature backend components to prepare the ML model either using obfuscation or cryptography. The backend activity can be a one-time task during the release of the ML models or a just-in-time approach. In the just-in-time approach, the model would be obfuscated or encrypted before being downloaded to the end user’s desktop. 3. Expected Solution.

UIDAI believes that CAPTCHA is a barrier to smooth resident engagement with the aadhaar portals and therefore intends to remove it soon. Instead of active CAPTCHA, UIDAI is looking for a passive solution that can differentiate between a bot and a human operator. 2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to develop a solution, mostly following a passive approach through collection of environmental parameters and using AI/ML to analyze it in the backend to differentiate between bot and human-being. The passive solution may capture environmental details through the browser context and analyze the same with the help of ML models deployed in the backend. This solution, once accepted would be used by the UIDAI to protect all backend APIs from DoS/DDoS based vulnerabilities. The solution must meet the following requirements:- 3. The proposed solution must meet the following objectives. 3.1 Feature Requirements. The solution must define the list of environmental parameters that need to be captured to differentiate between a bot and a human being. If passive parameter analysis is unable to differentiate, then the user may be asked to do a few minimal interactions with the portal. User experience is important to UIDAI and hence human interaction is to be limited. 3.2 Frontend code to capture environmental or human interaction data must be compliant with the javascript framework. Participating teams may choose to use any framework like React/TypeScript/Flutter to demonstrate the solution. 3.3 As part of the solution, the required backend ML model to analyze the front- end capture of environment parameters or human interaction data must be developed to demonstrate the solution. The ML model must be pluggable so that it can be integrated with the UIDAI application stack to protect the APIs. 3.4 The solution must adhere to the core privacy policies of UIDAI. 5.

         "2.1 Background: 2.1.1 Procurement is an essential component of any project. There are set rules and procedures to undertake various kinds of procurements. Each procurement methodology has several milestones, which too need careful planning and execution, to avoid time and cost over runs. 2.1.2 As such, Government procurements are driven by the General Financial Rules (GFRs) and the Manuals for Procurement of Goods and of Services. Needless to say, all procurements are made keeping in mind transparency, fair competition amongst vendors as well as cost reasonability for the product services, as public money is involved. 2.1.3 One of the important methodologies often employed in procurement processes is establishing the ‘price reasonability’ for a certain product/service. This methodology is generally applied at two stages, viz. while obtaining administrative approval for procuring the said product/service, and before opening the commercial bids of qualified vendors. 2.1.4 The process of ascertaining the price reasonability of any product/service of interest is commonly known as Price Benchmarking. 2.2 Detailed Description: 2.2.1 There are various strategies to benchmark the cost. Some of them are as follows: i. Sometimes, the cost of the product or the rate at which service is to be hired are already defined by the Government. For example, labor rates. ii. It may be possible that a similar product/service has been procured by the department in recent past. This can be taken as reference, known as the Last Purchase Price. iii. When none of the above is known, the most prevalent technique to gather information about the approximate value of the product/service is Market Survey. 2.2.2 Market Survey may be carried out physically by a team, as the name suggests, by actually visiting the market. However, this practice is only feasible for common goods/services such as stationery, common electrical appliances (AC, Fan, Lights etc), common services (sanitation, horticulture, maintenance etc). In case of sophisticated systems like Networking Solutions, Communication Systems, Sensors, Payloads and other Electronic Systems, this method does not work. In such cases, the market survey is carried out from information available in public domain. 2.2.3 This presents a complex problem. Information about prices of items which are used in abundancy by various departments (e.g. routers, switches, Hard Disk Drives, Laptops, Workstations, Graphics Cards etc), are available in the public domain, generally speaking. On the other hand, Information about prices of not so common items (e.g. Microwave Devices, Waveguides, Transmission Lines, Antennae, HF/VHF equipment, Software Defined Radios, etc) may or may not be available, resulting in a hit- and-trial approach). 2.2.4 Therefore a web-based application, which can assist various teams to tabulate the approximate price of products/services from various sources from information available in public domain, would be very useful. The contours of such an application is explained in subsequent paragraphs. 2.3 Expected Solution: 2.3.1 The solution will be web based. Users will first register themselves and thereafter use it, through their login credentials. The application interface will be simple without unnecessary graphics and multimedia for quick loading and fast responsiveness. 2.3.2 The users can query the applications either by providing the exact make/model or the most relevant specifications in case of Products, or by providing general information in case of Services. 2.3.3 Based on the inputs provided by the user, the application will use an appropriate method to crawl the web and gather information, which will then be presented to the user. The minimum input fields and the expected output fields are explained below, for various scenarios.

In addition, one important requirement of Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) is that solution should be “offline and on-premise” and should be “updated with latest definition on regular basis”. Therefore, the reliable and effective solution can be developed by creating a pipeline combining multiple AV engines working parallelly offline. Description: To develop a scanning pipeline in which the data residing in “Target Folder” will be scanned automatically by multiple antiviruses and accordingly the cleaned files will be in same folder and the infected files will be segregated and transferred in a specific folder i.e. “Infected Folders” with their analysis report. In addition, the path of each infected file will also be recorded in a separate doc file in same Infected folders. The functional block diagram is depicted below: Target Folder -> Offline Parallel -> Infected Files One VM may be used for one AV which will be updated regularly (as per respective AV update policy) with latest definition of respective AV. The free/trail version of AVs can be used for building and testing the features of parallel AV pipeline. Atleast following three AVs should be included in AV pipeline: 1. Window Defender 2. Trend Micro Maximum Security 3. Eset Internet Security Expected Solution: The details of expected outcomes are given below: (a). Raw Data will be kept at “Target folder” and available multiple antiviruses should recognize the presence of data and start scanning automatically. (b). Cleaned file will be in same folders and Infected files & its Analysis Report should be move to a dedicated defined “Infected folder”. The path of each infected file will also be recorded in one doc file. (c). The scanning process shall be continued till all infected files are segregated. After successful completion by multiple AVs, a popup message of “Scanning Completed” should be displayed.

         null,
         "Background Hydraulic transients, or water hammer phenomena, occur when there is a sudden change in water flow velocity, causing rapid pressure fluctuations within a hydraulic system. In hydropower and pumped storage schemes, these transients can lead to severe consequences such as pipe bursts, equipment damage, structural failures, and operational inefficiencies. Accurate prediction and management of these transients are essential to maintain the integrity, safety, and efficiency of these systems. Due to certain limitations in the existing models, there is a need for more precise, comprehensive and adaptable models that can simulate complex transient scenarios under varying operational conditions. Description There is a need for developing an advanced hydraulic transient analysis model that can accurately predict and manage the dynamic behavior of water within hydropower and pumped storage systems. This model should provide accurate and reliable results during tripping of units or sudden power failure. Under these conditions, the machine and water conductor system needs to be protected from damages. The time of closure of the guide vanes play an important role in avoiding adverse effects. The delay in closure of guide vanes causes speed rise on the machine and fast closure causes pressure rise issues. The goal is to enhance the resilience and performance of hydropower and pumped storage infrastructures by addressing the causes and consequences of hydraulic transients comprehensively. Expected Solution There is need to develop a sophisticated model that can incorporate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the transient behavior of water within the water conductor system. This model should be able to handle complex scenarios such as sudden load changes, emergency shutdowns, start-up and other operational variations. Provide clear visual representations of pressure fluctuations, flow velocities and potential risk areas. This model should be adaptable to different hydropower and pumped storage systems with varying configurations and operational requirements.",

         "Background: Namami Gange is a flagship program of the government of India for the rejuvenation of Ganga and its tributaries. NMCG Authority order of Oct 2016 States the the pollution in River Ganga and its tributaries shall also be monitored by use of satellite and other remote sensing technologies. As pupulations increase in the Ganga Basin, there are growing water demands, and hence higher levels of sewage flow into rivers of the Ganga Basin from both rural and urban areas. Excess untreated water entering the Ganga river systems transports high organic and pathogen loads. Their use generates high levels of pollution with significant organic loads, with very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand. This will inevitably lower Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, thereby threatening fisheries and biodiversity (maacroinvertebrates). At the same time, the high sewage discharges affect the suitability of the river for bathing due to the higher levels ofpathogens in rivers. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of rainfall events, this is becoming a significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the rivers of Ganga Basin. Description: An AI-enabled decision support system may be developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data, IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements, in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological & hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River. Model source code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time series database and automated workflows continually check observations against forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling. The overall strategy for the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app, to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems. Expected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow and water quality using hydrological & hydro dynamical models at multiple locations in a river network. a. To create historical simulations of flow and water quality, as well as a three to 5 day ahead forecast at any location down the Ganga River, and to provide a tool that scientists, managers, or the general public might use. b. Dashboard may show the following options i. Ganga River set up a map with options for plotting flow, nitrate, ammonia, phosphorus, DO,BOD,Fecal Coliform and; etc. ii. It may show a time series plot of paramenters such as rainfall, flow, DO, BOD, Fecal Coliform and nitrate for the Ganga River over the past 10 days and a forecast ahead of 3 days. 2. Alrets can be sent out to decision makers providing notice of an extreme event, e.g., pollution discharge, combined sewer pverflows discharges, high pathogen events, or a pulse of high nitrate water moving down the river system. 3.

         "Description: 1. National Security Guard (NSG) operates inside buildings, built up areas and other infrastructures like metro stations, schools, etc in case of any terror. Since the operations are of National security significance, better understanding of the target layout is of paramount importance. 3-Dimensional walk through of the buildings helps in the efficient understanding of the target layout and also enables effective briefing of the troops by the Commander for operating inside such targets. 2. Presently, the building authorities provide 2-Dimensional layout of the building in the form of blue prints/ floor plan. Assimilation of the situation and appreciating the potent threat with the help of 2-Dimensional layout turns out to be a challenging task. In such a scenario, a 3-Dimensional walk-through of the building helps significantly in increasing the efficiency of the ground forces while operating. 3. The software which needs to be developed should take the 2-Dimensional blueprint layout as input and also should take various parameters like length, breadth, height of the building, layout of staircase, entry and exit, etc as additional inputs. The software should then export them to a file and create a full fledged 3-Dimensional walkthrough model of the building. The software must also include the facility for integration of exported model to the offline Google maps, Satellite pictures (if any available). 4. Since the target includes buildings which are secretive in nature, the software is required to be operable fully in standalone mode, without any internet connectivity required in future. For the initial installation phase, the system can be connected to the internet to facilitate fetching up of Maps, satellite imagery from open source, etc required for the software functioning. 5. This software would also reduce the time taken during the initial briefing of the troops prior to the launch of any operation. It further increases the efficiency of the operations, thus resulting in early success. 6. The conversion of 2-Dimensional blueprints to 3-Dimensional models must address following problems. (a) Software should take 2-Dimensional blueprint as an input and produce 3- Dimensional walk through as output. (b) Provisions to input parameters like length, breadth, height of the building and other details should be included. (c) Minimum supervision from the user end should be needed to finalise the conversion. (d) Offline integration with Google maps, satellite imagery to get enhanced output covering the nearby geographical areas as well.",

Apart from this, the Force also has important roles in many internal security duties and operations against the left wing extremism in the state of Chhattisgarh. Description: 1. The system should leverage advanced AI algorithms to analyze real-time data from various sources, including surveillance cameras, Drones Sensors and satellite imagery to provide actionable insights to ITBP personnel deployed in remote border regions. 2. Key functionalities should include intelligent threat detection, anomaly identification, predictive maintenance for equipment and infrastructure, route optimization for patrols and automated reporting of incidents. 3. The system should be scalable, adaptable to rugged terrain and harsh environmental conditions and seamlessly integrate with existing ITBP command and control systems for enhanced operations effectiveness and border security. Expected solution: 1. Tools of AI should be developed for popular social sites. 2. A Central Agency develop tools on AI-powered operational management system to optimize resource utilization, enhance situational awareness and improve decision-making process",

         "Description: The world today has bought on a need to pay increased attention to safety and security issues, for example, search and rescue operations, surveillance, and protection of critical infrastructure. These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class. Background: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately. Detailed Description: Classification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler’s, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis. A Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification. Expected Solution: Input: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird Output: Class of the object(Drone or Bird)",

         "Background 1. Article 243G of the Constitution of India acknowledges Panchayats as institutions of local self-government and mandates them to prepare plans for economic development and social justice. As local government, Gram Panchayats (GPs) are responsible for delivery of basic services to local citizens and address the vulnerabilities of poor and marginalized ones. This can only be achieved through implementation of well thought out plans through efficient and responsible utilization of available resources. 2. An efficient and robust planning process as part of GP’s core functioning becomes necessary. GP development plan should ideally match people’s needs and priorities with the available resources. It should be prepared through a fair, inclusive, transparent, and participatory process. The focus should be on local development issues, local perception of need and priority, local analysis of problems and solutions, and local resources management all within a collective local vision. 3. Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP) to be prepared for effective implementation of flagship schemes/ programmes on subjects of National importance. The formulation process of Panchayat Development Plans (PDP) must be comprehensive and based on participatory process, which inter alia involves the full convergence of the schemes of Central and State Governments related to 29 subjects listed in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution. 4. A need was felt to take forward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) up to the last mile, i.e., up to the GP level, leveraging a wide network and strong institutional mechanism of third tier of Government including Traditional Bodies of non-part IX areas. Accordingly, the Ministry has adopted a thematic approach aggregating 17 SDGs into 9 broad themes for Localization of Sustainable Development Goals (LSDGs) at grassroot level through Panchayats adopting ‘Whole of Government and Whole of Society Approach’ and the PDPs will be prepared adopting thematic approach to achieve localization for SDGs in rural India. 29 Subjects defined in the Eleventh Schedule 1. Agriculture 2. Poverty all eviation programme 3. Land Improvement. 4. Education 5. Minor Irrigation 6. Vocational education 7. Animal Husbandary 8. Adult and non-formal education 9. Fisheries 10. Libraries 11. Social Forestery 12. Cultural activites 13. Minor forest produce 14. Markets and fairs 15. Small scale industires 16. Health and Sanitation 17. Khadi, village and cottage industries 18. Family welfare 19. Rural Housing 20. Women and child development 21. Drinking water 22. Social Welfare 23. Fuel and fodder 24. Welfare of the weaker sections 25. Roads 26. Public distribution system 27. Rural electrification 28. Maintenance of community assets 29. Non-Conventional energy Description Design a game for a Hackathon event that enhances participant engagement, fosters planning, and develops a better Panchayat/Village development The objective is to create a gamified experience that can help villagers/youth, etc. to prepare a village development plan. A simulated environment is needed to develop a self-sustained village development plan game where the user can plan various facilities in the village using the resources available. It is envisaged to develop ‘Farmville’ kind of a game for a village. Developers can use any game development platform to create the game for android platform. SVAMITVA Scheme GIS data maps of villages will be provided as input. Key Components to include for the game app: Budget Estimate: Functionality to add the estimate for each type of activity for which planning is required. For example, if new/extension road needs to be constructed for the gram panchayat / village, it should allow us to add the budget for road feature planning. Work Model: Development of a game for taking up works under Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) such as road construction, drainage construction, establishment of toilets, streetlights, etc. The basic steps of the Game broadly involve: - i. Select the village, where development plan is required by the villagers. ii. Based on the input received such as the village building footprints, road network, etc., develop the 3D visualization of the existing village for which development plan is required. iii. Superimpose the SVAMITVA Scheme maps/drone data to have a real-world visualization of the village. iv. Developmental activities would provide the list of activities that a plan would be composed. For example, a new road laying for a stretch in the village, laying of drainage pipeline for the village, drinking water pipeline for all the villagers, etc. v. There is resource envelope/money available with Panchayats under different Schemes for different types of developmental work. Once the development activity as in point iv above is planned in the game, the amount shall be deducted from the Resource Envelope allocated to Panchayats. vi. Generate a more realistic 3D model with other existing features. vii. Arrive at a tentative estimate for the planning being performed. viii. Ability to provide a walkthrough of the 3D platform. ix. Ability to provide a fly-through of the 3D platform. A few examples of probable use cases are indicated below: - Case1: Road laying activity • The player selects the start point and endpoint with intermediate points wherever required for road construction. It needs to validate that any road laying activity may not be a duplicate road construction plan. • The player can select the type of the road, width of the road; height of the road etc., based on the selection, the road should be built in the game. Based on changing the parameters like type of road from BT road to cement road, it should be regenerated. • Once the road construction is done by the player, cost of construction should be auto generated. • Ability to measure the road dimensions and road shoulders. Case 2: Streetlight • The player selects the road where streetlight is required. The streetlight is added based on the game artefacts. • The player has option to check the light illumination based on the time of the day for best location for streetlight along the road. Option to change the type of lamp, based on the lamp change – the changes to reflect on the game for best results. • Once finalized, the cost estimate of the street lighting to be generated. Case 3: Ability to measure the building height and width of each side. • The player selects the village for developmental activity. • The player is presented with a 3D simulated environment representing selected village. • The player can measure the height of building and all sides to create the dimension of the house along with roof type area. Expected Solution Panchayats have been the fulcrum of local self-government since ancient times, exercising both executive and judicial powers over village-level issues. We plan to develop a virtual 3D environment-based gaming platform for village/Panchayat development plan activities. • A detailed game outlining the work model. • Prototypes or mock-ups of the game platform/interface. • Documentation on implementation guidelines and best practices for integrating the gamification system into the Hackathon event. 1.

         "Background 1. The Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the SVAMITVA Scheme on the National Panchayati Raj Day, 24th April 2020 with a resolve to enable the economic progress of Rural India by providing “Record of Rights” to every rural household owner. The scheme aims to demarcate inhabited (Abadi) land in rural areas through the latest surveying drone technology, Continuous Operating Reference System (CORS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetization of properties and enabling bank loan; reducing property-related disputes; comprehensive village-level planning 2. With the use latest drone technology and CORS technology for the Abadi land survey, the high resolution and accurate image base maps of 50 cm have facilitated creation of the most durable record of property holdings in these areas with no legacy revenue records. Such accurate image-based maps provide a clear demarcation of land holdings in a very short frame of time compared to on ground physical measurement and mapping of the land parcels. Description i. Develop an AI model capable of identifying key features in orthophotos with high precision: Use of AI/ML techniques for extraction of the following features from SVAMITVA Drone Imagery using a cloud-based solution: - a. Building footprint extraction (built-up area from the drone image and classified roof-top based on observation on the imagery as RCC, Tiled, Tin, and Others. These built up area can be used for various service such as solar energy calculation, property tax calculation, etc.) b. Road feature extraction c. Waterbodies extraction, etc ii. Achieve a target accuracy of 95% in feature identification. iii. Optimize the model for efficient processing and deployment. The broad scope of work includes:- i. Data Preparation: Utilize the SVAMITVA Scheme drone-labeled datasets for 10 villages to train and validate the AI model. ii. Model Development: Employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or other suitable AI/ML models for image segmentation and feature identification. iii. Model Training: Efficient training of the model ensures it learns to identify the desired features accurately. iv. Model Optimization: Fine-tune the model to achieve the target accuracy of 95%, optimizing for speed and resource utilization. v. Testing and Validation: Rigorously test the model on a separate dataset to ensure its accuracy and reliability. vi. Deployment and Integration: Prepare the model for deployment and integration into the Ministry of Panchayati Raj’s existing systems for practical application. Expected Solution i. A fully trained and optimized AI model for feature identification in orthophotos. ii. Documentation detailing the model architecture, training process, and deployment guidelines. iii. A final report summarizing the project outcomes, including accuracy metrics and recommendations for future improvements.",

         "Background: In an institute environment, multiple users often require access to the same datasets for various purposes. However, due to lack of communication or visibility, these users may unknowingly download duplicate copies of the same data. This leads to unnecessary consumption of resources, including bandwidth and storage, and complicates data management. The DDAS (Data download Duplication Alert System) addresses this issue by notifying users with an alert if a potential duplicate download is identified. This system helps optimize resource usage, save time, and streamline data management processes. Description: Managing data downloads efficiently is crucial for optimizing resources and maintaining order in any organization. A DDAS addresses the issue of multiple users inadvertently downloading duplicate copies of the same datasets across various fields. The DDAS operates by maintaining a repository or database that records metadata of all downloaded datasets. This metadata includes details such as file names, sizes, timestamps, and download locations. When a user initiates a download request, the system checks the database to determine if the dataset has already been downloaded by any user. To identify duplicates accurately, the system uses file history or unique identifiers, ensuring duplicates are detected even if file names differ. If a potential duplicate is detected, the system prompts the user with an alert. This alert provides comprehensive information about the existing dataset, including its location and the timestamp of the original download. By doing so, the DDAS helps users avoid unnecessary downloads, thereby optimizing resource usage, saving time, and streamlining data management processes. This system is designed to be flexible and applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, and any other domain where efficient data management is critical. By preventing duplicate downloads, the DDAS ensures that resources are used effectively, contributing to overall organizational efficiency. Expected Solution: To mitigate this issue, a robust solution is needed to design and develop a system that generates alerts when users attempt to download data already available within the institute's repository or any of the user accounts. The alert system should promptly notify users about the existence, properties (such as the period, spatial domain, and other relevant data attributes), and location of the required data, thereby preventing unnecessary duplication and promoting efficient resource utilization. Implementing this solution allows organizations to streamline data access processes and reduce redundancy. This system has to be applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, government agencies, and more.",

         "Background: Synthetically-generated audios and videos i.e. deep fakes are in trends nowadays. Although these have caught imagination of computer and tech savvy generation, at the same time, these have created concerns because of their ability to disrupt nation’s politics, committing frauds, create dis-information and creating non-consensual contents. Use of Deep fake has also been seen recently to purposefully defame the character of a person in specific. Due to enhancements in AI/ML and Large Language Models for Generative AI, identification and detection of deep fakes have created a huge challenge for Security Agencies. Research on multiple aspects of deep fake identification has been started. As a use case for the problem statement, a forensic technique to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's may be developed. Detailed description: Addressing the deep fake problem requires a multi-pronged approach, combining technology, regulation, education, and collaboration to mitigate the risks and protect individuals and society. However, on the technological front Detecting deep fakes involves development and testing with numerous advanced algorithms and tools. Here are some of the prominent approaches and technologies that can be used in deep fake detection: i.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs can be trained to detect inconsistencies in facial features, expressions, and movements. CNNs can also analyse video frames over time to identify unnatural transitions and discrepancies. ii.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: RNNs and LSTMs can be used to analyse the sequence of frames in a video to detect temporal anomalies and inconsistencies indicative of deep fakes. iii.Capsule Networks: Capsule networks can identify discrepancies in facial pose and texture. iv.Adversarial Training: Adversarial training involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate deep fakes and simultaneously training another model to detect them improving the robustness of detection algorithms. v.Audio-Visual Inconsistencies: Combining audio and visual analysis can also help detect deep fakes by identifying mismatches between lip movements and speech, or inconsistencies in ambient sounds. vi.Blockchain Technology: Using blockchain to create immutable records of media, providing a verifiable chain of custody for digital content to ensure its authenticity. vii.Frequency Analysis: Analysing the frequency domain of images and videos to detect anomalies and artefacts introduced during the deep fake creation process. viii.Biometric Verification: Analysing subtle behavioural traits such as micro-expressions, eye and head movement to detect anomalies. ix.Hybrid Models: Using a combination of spatial, temporal, audio and frequency analysis to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep fake detection. Expected solution: A solution based on AI/ML technology may be developed to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's. This technique may be based on any of the above-mentioned methods or it may combine multiple methods and demonstrate the final deliverable of detection of deep fakes with accuracy. The input of the system will be a video which is suspected of deep fake and the output should contain detailed report w.r.t various characteristics of deep fake e.g. whether confirmed fake (details of abnormalities observed), mathematical underlying techniques of its creation.",

         "Background Many existing Dams and Reservoirs are built several decades ago with certain intended purposes. However, due to increasing population, change in extreme climatic conditions, improvement in agricultural practices there is a necessity for re-evaluation of the current infrastructure and water management practices. Description It is likely that existing dams get silted up over time and are unable to store sufficient water. Due to which there will be a shift in the command area or the cropping pattern. It is also a known fact that changing climate issues is also posing a problem, due to which there is need to review the agricultural requirement. The existing dams and reservoirs are increasingly vulnerable to the adverse climate change and shifts in agricultural practices. These changes can lead to structural stress, altered water availability and inefficiencies in water distribution and usage. There is an urgent need to develop and implement new monitoring and water management models to ensure the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of these critical infrastructures. Expected Solution This problem will address the safety and resilience of dams and reservoirs against climate - induced risks, enhance water resources management and optimally support the agricultural needs and environmental sustainability. There will also be a long-term planning of water infrastructure in the face of climate and agricultural changes. This needs work on the Hydrological impact due to changes in the climatic conditions, which in turn effect the water demand in the command area. The changing technology, and adaption of new agricultural practices should be taken into account. It is essential to implement a decision support system along with predictive analysis that provide insights to the water managers and policy makers on real-time data.",

         "BACKGROUND: In a SCADA system, for a pipeline network spanning thousands of kilometres, the network devices (both layer 2 and layer 3) are spread all along the geographical area. With such a large network, it becomes crucial, from both the maintenance and security point of view, to continuously monitor the complete network topology. Automatic topology discovery provides a complete and up-to-date map of all devices, connections, and pathways within the SCADA network. This comprehensive overview is essential for network administrators to understand the network's structure and dynamics. It ensures that any changes in the network, such as new devices being added or existing ones being removed, are automatically detected and documented in real time. When issues arise, knowing the exact layout and connections within the network helps in pinpointing problems more quickly, reducing downtime and improving response times. More significantly, automatic topology discovery helps in identifying unauthorized devices or unexpected changes in the network, which could indicate security breaches or cyber-attacks and allows for better network segmentation and implementation of access controls, limiting the spread of potential threats and protecting critical assets. Conventionally, automatic topology discovery tools utilize Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). However, these protocols are vulnerable due to lack of authentication, broadcast of sensitive information, etc. and hence are not suitable for use in a critical pipeline SCADA network. Problem Statement Details: “Develop a tool for automatic network topology discovery, for a network using EIGRP routing protocol, that does not rely on CDP or LLDP protocols. The tool may use secure SNMPv3 polls/traps, ARP/MAC tables, NetFlow, routing protocol or syslog data for creating the automatic network topology. The challenge is accurate device identification without relying on the broadcast capabilities of CDP/LLDP and determining the physical and logical connections between devices. It must have a provision to keep the topology map updated with real-time changes in the network along with scalability to ensure that the solution works efficiently across small to large-scale networks. The most important component is to maintain network security to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage during the discovery process.” NOTE : GAIL (INDIA) LTD will not provide any hardware, software, license, data or any other resource to SIH hackathon Teams.

All melas like SSA, MSSC, Public Provident Fund (PPF), Recurring Deposits (RD), Time Deposit ( TD) PLI, RPLI have been arranged in every city and villages without the knowledge of percentage of male/female/child/senior citizens and other sectors of people and as a result the success of all the melas are found not satisfactory. Expected Solution: The expected solution is pictorial data and actual demographic and economic location-wise population is to be identified. The demographic and location-wise population data is to be taken as a fundamental data towards improvement of financial (banking & insurance) services.",

         "Description: 1. National Security Guard (NSG) is a Federal Contingency Force, which operates within a Close Quarters Battle (CQB) environment in an urban warfare scenario. NSG operates on modus operandi of Small Team Operations, with the House Intervention Team (HIT) being the smallest combat unit. 2. In any CQB scenario, the NSG Task Force operates down to a HIT level with the Task Force Commander situated at the Integrated Command Post (ICP), with an aim to get real time location of the soldiers and a better tactical picture of the ongoing operations. The HITs mostly operate in built up areas (for example in Hotels, Hospitals, Metro stations, Buildings of National importance, etc) consisting of multiple floors and basements. Every soldier operates with the advanced military gear and radio communication utilized for conveying operational decisions. In such a setup, knowing the exact location of the soldier down to the floor/ basement is of paramount importance. 3. Traditional GPS/ GSM based solutions give the location on a 2D scale with no information regarding the floor at which the soldier is operating. Getting down to the floor level requires the installation of hardware on the floor for tracking the soldiers with the help of RFID or utilization of altimeter, accelerometer carried by the soldier. 4. Live location tracking in urban built up areas for CQB operations, addressing the following problems. (a) Location Tracking of HITs. Live tracking of HITs so that the Commander is able to track HITs operating on multiple floors/ basements. This helps in efficient command and control and thus enabling early success in the operations. (b) 3D Model. NSG keeps a database of 3D models of buildings which are potential targets for terror attacks. The 3D models of the buildings exist in the industry standard format. It is required that the resultant live location of the HITs (obtained through these trackers) be displayed on the pre-existing 3D models of the buildings.",

         "Background: Press Registrar General of India (PRGI) maintains a database containing approximately 160,000 titles. When a user submits a new title for verification, we need to check its similarity against the existing titles in our database. The goal is to ensure that the new title does not duplicate or closely resemble any existing title to avoid confusion and maintain uniqueness. Additionally, the system must enforce specific guidelines to ensure that certain words are not used, combinations of existing titles are not allowed, and titles with similar meanings or periodicity modifications are rejected. Problem Description Develop a system to automatically verify new title submissions by checking for similarities with existing titles in the database and ensuring compliance with specific guidelines. The system should reject titles that are too similar to existing ones, contain disallowed words, or violate other outlined rules. Additionally, the system should provide a probability score indicating the likelihood of a title being verified. Requirements: 1. Similarity Check: a. Implement a mechanism to check for similar-sounding names using phonetic similarity algorithms (e.g., Soundex, Metaphone). b. Identify titles that have common prefixes or suffixes (e.g., The, India, Samachar, News). c. Ensure that variations in spelling or slight modifications do not bypass the similarity check (e.g., Namaskar vs. Namascar). d. Calculate a similarity percentage for each title comparison. 2. Prefix/Suffix Handling: a. Maintain a list of disallowed prefixes and suffixes. b. Reject any new titles that include these disallowed prefixes or suffixes if they cause the new title to resemble an existing title closely. 3. Guideline Enforcement: a. Maintain a list of disallowed words (e.g., Police, Crime, Corruption, CBI, CID, Army). b. Ensure that titles containing these disallowed words are rejected. c. Prevent the creation of new titles by combining existing ones (e.g., if \"Hindu\" and \"Indian Express\" exist, \"Hindu Indian Express is not allowed\"). d. Check for titles with similar meanings in other languages and reject them (e.g., \"Daily Evening\" and \"Pratidin Sandhya\"). e. Disallow adding periodicity (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) to existing titles to form new ones. 4. Verification Probability: a. Provide a probability score indicating the likelihood of a title being verified. 5. Database Interaction: a. Efficiently search and compare new titles against the database of 160,000 titles. b. Track current applications and use them for future reference to reject similar titles submitted later. c. Use indexing and optimised search techniques to handle the large dataset and ensure quick responses. 6. User Feedback: a. Provide clear feedback to the user if their submitted title is too similar to an existing title, contains disallowed prefixes/suffixes, violates guidelines, or is created by combining existing titles. b. Display the verification probability to the user. c. Allow the user to modify their title and resubmit it for verification. 7. Scalability: a. Design the system to handle an increasing number of titles and user submissions. b. Ensure that the system remains performant as the database grows. Expected Solution: 1. The system will provide the probability of a title being verified. For instance, if a title has a similarity score of 80%, the verification probability shall not be more than 100%-80%=20% 2. The system will reject any new title that is too similar to existing ones, contains disallowed words or prefixes/suffixes, combines existing titles, or has similar meanings in other languages. 3. The system will track current applications and use them for future reference, rejecting similar titles submitted later by other users. Acceptance Criteria: 1. Accuracy: a. The system correctly identifies similar-sounding titles and provides consistent results. b. The system accurately rejects titles with disallowed prefixes, suffixes, and words. c. The system prevents the creation of titles by combining existing titles and identifies titles with similar meanings in other languages. d. The system disallows adding periodicity to existing titles. e. The system provides an accurate verification probability score. 2. Performance: a. Title verification is completed within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 2 seconds per title). b. The system can handle multiple title verification requests simultaneously without significant performance degradation. 3 User Experience: a. Users receive clear and actionable feedback on why their title was rejected. b. Users see a probability score indicating the likelihood of their title being verified. c. The interface for title submission and feedback is user-friendly and intuitive. 4 Robustness: a. The system handles edge cases and variations in spelling effectively. b. The system is resilient to errors and provides meaningful error messages when issues occur.",
