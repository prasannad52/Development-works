         "Description: The world today has bought on a need to pay increased attention to safety and security issues, for example, search and rescue operations, surveillance, and protection of critical infrastructure. These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class. Background: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately. Detailed Description: Classification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler’s, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis. A Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification. Expected Solution: Input: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird Output: Class of the object(Drone or Bird)",

         "Background: The load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand. Description: The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs. Further, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive. Expected Solution: An Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.",

         "Background: There are numerous engineering and polytechnic institutes in Rajasthan running under the Department of Technical Education, Government of Rajasthan. Notably, during the admission process, there is a significant increase in enquiries from various groups, including students, their parents, and other stakeholders. These enquiries cover a wide range of queries related to admission process, eligibility criteria, information about different colleges, fee structure, curriculum , scholarship , hostel facilities, previous year's college and branch-specific allotments placement opportunities and many more. Currently, stakeholders have tocontact colleges individually through phone or email, and sometimes even visit the colleges personally. This process is not only cumbersome for the stakeholders but also demanding to pool manpower for the colleges to manage these inquiries. Detailed Description: With the continuous rise in enquiries, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the colleges to respond promptly and effectively using traditional communication methods. To address this issue more efficiently and ensure timely assistance for everyone, there is a pressing need to adopt new technological solutions. One effective approach is to develop an AI-powered chatbot at centralized level that would serve as a virtual assistant, available 24/7 to answer a wide range of questions. By automating responses to common enquiries, the chatbot would significantly enhance the accessibility to important information and allow staff to focus on handling more complex queries and other critical tasks. For example, the chatbot would provide insights into information about various engineering and polytechnic colleges that falls under the jurisdiction of Department of Technical Education, and guide users through the admission processes, explain fee structures, share curriculum updates, provide details about available scholarships, share alumni information, and share information on job placement opportunities etc This will empower the technical education department because of the ease of providing information, help and advice instantly to prospective students, their parents, and all interested parties. The required information provided by all colleges can be integrated with ease in software. Expected Solutions: 1. Efficient Information Retrieval: The chatbot should rapidly access and provide accurate information from a comprehensive database on topics such as admissions, fees, scholarships, recommendations based on previous years cutoff, minimizing the need for human assistance. Incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to support voice based assistance in English languages and can be extended in Hindi and other regional languages ensuring wide accessibility and understanding. 2. Enhanced User Experience: Design an intuitive interface that allows users to navigate easily and find information quickly. The interface should be straightforward, accessible on common platform, and capable of understanding natural language, ensuring user-friendliness. 3. Reduced Workload: By automating responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s), the chatbot will reduce the workload on department staff, allowing them to concentrate on more complex and urgent tasks. 4. Data Insights: The chatbot will gather valuable data from user interactions, helping the department to identify common concerns and optimize it’s services based on these insights.",

         "Background: India faces a complex challenge in balancing its reliance on coal for energy with its climate change commitments. Coal mining is a major source of carbon emissions, a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. To achieve carbon neutrality, the Indian coal sector needs to offset its emissions. This can be done through a combination of strategies like reducing emissions from mining activities, adopting cleaner technologies, and offsetting remaining emissions by planting trees that absorb carbon dioxide. A web-based application can be a powerful tool in this journey by helping quantify a mine's carbon footprint and evaluate potential pathways to carbon neutrality. Description: The web based application will have following objectives: Activity wise quantification of Carbon emission in Coal Mines Estimation of existing Carbon Sinks Gap analysis between C emission and sinks and suggesting pathways to carbon neutrality Expected Solution: A comprehensive software solution that includes: Emission estimation: The app would allow users to input data on various mining activities (e.g., excavation, transportation, equipment usage) and estimate the associated carbon emissions based on establishd emission factors. Estimation of Per Capita emissions of a Mine. Carbon Neutrality Pathways: The app could offer features for simulating different emission reduction strategies like: Clean technologies: Assessing the impact of adopting electric vehicles, methane capture systems, and renewable energy sources for mine operations. Afforestation offsets: Calculating the amount of land required for tree plantation to offset remaining emissions based on state specific afforestation plan and Carbon emission reduction. Other Renewables: explore alternative use of energy to reduce direct electricity consumption. Any other pathways: Carbon Credits: Estimation of potential Carbon credit earned as per present market rates. Data visualization: The app should present results visually, using charts and graphs to track emission trends and the effectiveness of implemented strategies. Scalability: Design the app to accommodate different mine sizes and types (underground vs open-cast). Benefits: Transparency: Providing a clear picture of a mine's carbon footprint. Decision support: Helping mine operators make informed choices for emission reduction. Cost savings: Identifying opportunities to optimize operations and potentially reduce costs associated with emissions. Sustainability goals: Aiding Indian coal mines in their journey towards carbon neutrality and supporting the country's overall climate goals.",

         "Description: Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems are the solar power generating products or systems that are seamlessly integrated into the building envelop. The satellite data from Indian Satellites such as Cartosat-2/3 and Cartosat-1 are capable of generating 3D city models up to LoD-1. These LoD1 models, which are derived by extruding a footprint to a uniform height, can be used for simulating building shadows. This project aims to develop an interactive application for assessing BIPV potential using LOD-1 3D city model. It will involve simulating shadow of adjoining buildings on each face of the building and estimating incident solar energy on the vertical face of the building. The application will render the building surface according to available BIPV potential. Challenge: * 3D Visualisation of LOD-1 City Model * Simulating Building Shadows in 3D * 3D Rendering of BIPV Potential on Building Usage: Application of Space-based inputs for Renewable Energy Users: The application will be deployed on VEDAS portal's '3D City Model and Rooftop Solar Potential' application. It will be usefu for Policy-makers (State & Central Government), Solar Energy Solution Providers, Architects and citizens. Available Solutions (if Yes, reasons for not using them): Commercial Architectural Packages like Autodesk are suitable for building-level analysis and require substantial level of details. 3D GIS packages such as ESRI City Engine or Cesium provide visualisation capabilities. Software for city-wide BIPV potential estimation are currently not available in public domain. Desired Outcome: An interactive application where user provides a date (for calculating sun-position) and daily Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) value, and the application generates corresponding 3D city model rendered according to incident solar energy for that day. The application also provide total BIPV and rooftop PV energy potential available in the building.",

Climate change is increasing the number and size of glacial lakes, heightening the risk of GLOFs. Curent monitoring and prediction methods can be improved with advanced technologies like remote sensing, sensors installed near glacial lakes and machine learning. • Description: The aim is to develop a remote sensing and/or sensor-based Early Warning System (EWS) for GLOFs by utilizing remote sensing data, network of IoT sensors and advanced data analytics. The system will continuously monitor and identify critical changes in lake size, water level, temperature, sudden water flow, dam stability and ground movement etc. around glacial lakes. The machine learning algorithms will analyse the information to detect early signs of potential outbursts. This approach will significantly enhance the capability to predict and respond to GLOFs, improving safety, reducing economic losses, and contributing to resilient infrastructure planning in glacial regions. • Expected Solution: A Sensor which can be installed in glacial lake area, or a predictive model that significantly improves the Early Warning System ability for GLOFs, providing critical lead time for evacuation and mitigation efforts.",
